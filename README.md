# Vehicle Inheritance Demo



This project demonstrates the use of **Interfaces**, **Abstract Classes**, and **Inheritance** in C# using a simple vehicle hierarchy.



## How to Run



Navigate to the build output directory:

```bash

cd Executive/bin/Debug/net8.0

./Executive.exe

```



Alternatively, you can double-click on `Executive.exe` to run it.



## Class Hierarchy

**Note:** I intentionally didn't create an abstract class like `LandVehicles` for `Car` for demonstration purposes.



## Changes Made to the Given Interface Template



In the provided template, the `Start` function had a return type of `void`. I changed it to `string`.



## Unit Tests



I have written a total of 13 unit tests that check every single functionality in the project.
