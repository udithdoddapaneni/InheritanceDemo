\# Vehicle Inheritance Demo



This project demonstrates the use of \*\*Interfaces\*\*, \*\*Abstract Classes\*\*, and \*\*Inheritance\*\* in C# using a simple vehicle hierarchy.

Navigate to the build output directory:

```

cd Executive/bin/Debug/net8.0

\## Class Hierarchy:

I intentionally didn't make any abstract class like LandVehicles for Car for demonstration purposes

## Changes I have made in the given interface template:


In the given template you have given the function `Start` with return type `void`, in mine I just changed it to `string`



\## Unit Tests

In total I have written 13 unit tests checking every single functionality.

You can find the unit test file under ```UnitTests/InheritanceTests.cs```
